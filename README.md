**Data Engineer SQL Journey**

A curated SQL portfolio focused on data engineering use cases, including data transformation, aggregation, incremental processing, and data quality monitoring.

This repository demonstrates:
	•	Practical SQL patterns for ETL-style workflows
	•	Incremental loading and materialization strategies
	•	UPSERT logic for stateful aggregates
	•	Data quality checks with STOP vs FLAG decisions
	•	Monitoring queries for data observability

The project uses an astronomy observation dataset to simulate real-world data engineering scenarios.

Key focus:
Writing SQL that supports reliable, maintainable, and scalable data pipelines — not just analytical queries.
