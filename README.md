**Data Engineer SQL Journey**

A curated SQL portfolio focused on data engineering use cases, including data transformation, aggregation, incremental processing, and data quality monitoring.

This repository demonstrates:
1. Practical SQL patterns for ETL-style workflows
2. Incremental loading and materialization strategies
3. UPSERT logic for stateful aggregates
4. Data quality checks with STOP vs FLAG decisions
5. Monitoring queries for data observability

The project uses an astronomy observation dataset to simulate real-world data engineering scenarios.

Key focus:
Writing SQL that supports reliable, maintainable, and scalable data pipelines — not just analytical queries.
